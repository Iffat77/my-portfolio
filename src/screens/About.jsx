      <h1 className='about-title'> About </h1>
      <p className='about-body'> I am a Software Engineer who is motivated by finding innovative and efficient ways to improve products that impact people's daily lives.My passions include music, racing, and full-stack development in all of these areas of my life. I enjoy studying the way technology can optimize processes. I spent time learning Ableton Live software to create music, and am an avid fan of Formula 1 Racing where races are won not only by skilled drivers but by the teams that can make the most efficient vehicles and utilize their features well. As a developer I take this inspiration to think outside of the box to create efficient projects with clean and simple code. Collaborating is deeply important to me; having accessible code for my peers to interact with and making sure every teammate's voice is heard throughout the process leads to optimal results. I pride myself on contributing creative ideas, an ability to actively listen, and dedication for my craft.</p>
